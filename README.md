Challenge:
We would like you to build the frontend of a small webapp based on the wireframes attached along with this mail. We've also attached a zip file containing the assets.


Webapp description:
* The Browse page where you can see a grid of products
* The Product detail page (PDP) where you can see the details of a product
* The Cart page where you can see all the items you've added to cart
* Clicking on a product in Cart or Browse page should show the PDP page
* Clicking on Cart or Browse button at top should take the user to the respective pages
* Clicking on Brands or Price filters in sidebar should show only the products that match the values
* Use the mock data and assets provided in the zip file to populate the above filters and products views

 
Requirements:
* Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Preferred Use Angular > 2.x for UI in application. ( If not comfortable, can use React )
* Prefer Flexbox/CSS grids for CSS layouts
* Donâ€™t use other DOM manipulation libs like jQuery
* Don't use any HTML or CSS frameworks like bootstrap, skeleton, material etc.
* Can depend on data management libs like Redux, MobX etc. if required.
